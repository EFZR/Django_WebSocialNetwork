# Django_WebSocialNetwork

## Project Description

The project has the purpose of creating a social network with the Django framework, using the channels library to create a chat.
With this project is possible to create Posts, Comments, Likes, Friends, Groups, and a Chat in real time.
This was done with the purpose of learning the Django framework and the channels library and to expand my knowledge in the Python language, and last but not least, to have fun.
If you have any interest in the project, you can clone it and use it as you wish, try to follow the steps to install the project, so you can have the same libraries and versions that I used.
I also would be very grateful if you could give me some feedback on my code, so I can improve my skills.
Hope you find this project useful and if you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know to my email emerson.zapatarivas@gmail.com.
A greet from Honduras and have a nice day, don't forget to leave your star.
